## Android App
All of the components for the android app

## DataInteraction
Folder for all of the code (data classes, readers, writers, processors) used to deal with reading and writing from our json files, and eventually the database

## data
Stores the data for the app (json files and eventually database files)

## lib
Libraries used, like .jar files. Currently has the JSON file reading jar file used in hw1 and hw2. Eventually we are planning to make the code in our DataInteraction folder into a jar file so we can use it in both our android app and web app.
